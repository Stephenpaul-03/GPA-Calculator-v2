# GPA Calculator v2

## Description

Welcome to **GPA Calculator v2** ‚Äî MKII tool for calculating GPA or CGPA on a 10-point scale. Built using **React + Vite** with a sprinkle of **Chakra UI**, this version makes the process smoother than ever. You can manually input subject names, credits, and grades *or* use the **preset feature** to save time by selecting pre-configured college and department details.

This new version builds on the previous one [*more like a complete overhaul*] but packs even more convenience and flexibility.

## How GPA is Calculated

Before diving into the formula, here‚Äôs a quick breakdown of grades and their corresponding scores:

| Grade | Score |
|-------|-------|
| O     | 10    |
| A+    | 9     |
| A     | 8     |
| B+    | 7     |
| B     | 6     |
| C+    | 5     |
| C     | 4     |

### Calculation Method:

1. Multiply the score of each grade by its credit to calculate the **subject score**.
   - Example: If you scored an **A+** in Mathematics (üëè congrats!) and the credit is 4, then the score for Mathematics is **4 x 9 = 36**.

2. Add up the scores for all subjects.

3. Divide the total score by the **sum of the credits**.

   Here‚Äôs the formula:
   
   ```
   GPA = (Sum of (Grade x Credit)) / (Sum of Credits)
   ```

And there you have it! Easy, right? 

P.S. Both GPA and CGPA are calculated using the same method, so *technically*, you can add multiple semesters and calculate your CGPA up to that point.

```
If the app calculates both GPA and CGPA, does that make it a GPA calculator, a CGPA calculator, or something in between? ü§î
